# Getting started

## System requirements

### Getting PhysiCell

PhysiCOOL is a Python library built to work with PhysiCell, an open-source, agent-based modelling framework for 3-D multicellular simulations that is available online on [GitHub](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell). It is recommended that you use the latest PhysiCell version. Users can clone or download the repository, but it may be necessary to additionally install some software depending on the user's OS. PhysiCell video tutorials are available to set up PhysiCell for both Windows and MacOS:

- [Windows users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIP4JUrViRA)
- [MacOS users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq9nfKS5U0E)

In these tutorials, two options are offered: the "minimal" and the "traditional" setups. PhysiCOOL only requires the minimal setup. In addition, although users can follow these tutorials to install Python on their system by installing Anaconda, a more minimal distribution is available through Miniconda (see the following section for more details).

PDF versions of the setup process instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/physicell-training/ws2022/tree/main/setup) as well.

### Installing Python

Python can be installed by itself (follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), be sure to use a version supported by PhysiCOOL, i.e., `>=3.8` and `<3.11`). 

However it is generally easier to install a Python distribution, such as Anaconda, which already includes tools and libraries that make it easier to get started coding in Python. A minimal version of Anaconda is also available, which does not include as many libraries as Anaconda, but is sufficient to work with PhysiCOOL.

- Getting [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)
- Getting [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html)

Check out this [comparison between Anconda and Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda) if you are unsure about which distribution to use.

#### Installing Jupyter (optional)

Jupyter notebooks are applications that contain both **code** that can be modified and executed and **text** elements. Therefore, they are commonly used to share reproduceable code and include detailed descriptions of how that code was implemented.

PhysiCOOL does not need to be run in Jupyter Notebooks and it can be used in Python (`.py`) scripts. Thus, it is not mandatory to install Jupyter in order to use this library. However, PhysiCOOL examples are available as Jupyter Notebooks that aim to explain the library's main use cases while allowing users to change the code and run it to see the impact of their changes. To run these examples locally, you will need to install Jupyter.

Anaconda already includes Jupyter, so if you installed Anaconda you are all set. However, if you installed Python by itself or used Miniconda, you need to install `jupyter`, which can be done using `pip`, the Python package installer. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Installing PhysiCOOL

PhysiCOOL is available through pip using the following command:

```sh
pip install physicool
```

### Testing your PhysiCOOL installation

> Before testing PhysiCOOL, make sure that you are able to compile and run PhysiCell models in your local machine.

#### Changing parameter values in the configuration file

- Open a terminal and navigate (`cd`) to your PhysiCell repository;
- Populate the PhysiCell folder with a sample model by calling `make template`;
- Open the `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file found in the `config` folder and check the values for the `persistence_time` and `use_2d` (check the `<motility>` data). (These values should be `1` and `true`, respectively, as of PhysiCell version 1.10.4);
- Create a `.py` script in the PhysiCell folder called `update_config.py` containing the code below. It will update the motility values of the PhysiCell configuration file;

```python
# Updates the motility speed and status values in the PhysiCell_settings.xml file.
from physicool.config import ConfigFileParser

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Parse the data from the config file
    xml_data = ConfigFileParser()
    cell_data = xml_data.read_cell_data(name="default")
    # Update and write the new parameters to the config file
    cell_data.motility.speed = 20.0
    cell_data.motility.use_2d = False

    xml_data.write_motility_params(name="default", motility=cell_data.motility)
```

- Run the Python script by calling `python update_config.py` from your PhysiCell folder;
- Open the `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file and confirm that the `persistence_time` and `use_2d` values changed to `20` and `false`.

#### Compiling and running PhysiCell code

- Follow the instructions for the previous test;
- Create a `.py` script in the PhysiCell folder called `run_model.py` containing the code below. It will compile the PhysiCell code and run it.

```python
# Compiles the project, creates a black box object for it and runs it.
from physicool import optimization as opt

if __name__ == "__main__":
    opt.compile_project()
    my_model = opt.PhysiCellBlackBox(project_name="project")
    my_model.run()
```

- Run the Python script by calling `python run_model.py` from your PhysiCell folder;
- Open the `output` folder that it contains the output files for the simulation.

#### Reading results

- Follow the instructions for the previous test;
- Open the `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file found in the `config` folder and check the values for the `number_of_cells` (check the `<user_parameters>` data). (This value should be `5` as of PhysiCell version 1.10.4);
- Create a `.py` script in the PhysiCell folder called `read_cell_numbers.py` containing the code below. It will print the number of cells in each output file. **Warning**: If you are running a PhysiCell version below 1.10.3, change the version number in the code snippet to the version you are using.

```python
# Reads the number of cells in each output file and prints them.
from physicool.processing import get_cell_numbers_over_time

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cells = get_cell_numbers_over_time(version="1.10.4")
    print(cells)
```

- Run the Python script by calling `python read_cell_numbers.py` from your PhysiCell folder;
- Confirm that the first value is the same as the initial number of cells in the configuration file.

## Running examples

PhysiCOOL provides two main examples of how it can be used to perform calibration studies with PhysiCell:

- **Single-cell motility calibration study:**
Turning a PhysiCell model into a black-box that can be updated through Python + finding the best parameter values to model motility in the presence of a chemotactic gradient.

- **Third-party libraries:**
Using a third-party library ([psweep](https://github.com/elcorto/psweep)) to run parameter studies. Serves as an example of how PhysiCOOL can be integrated into a Python-based workflow to connect PhysiCell and other optimization libraries.

Additional examples:

- **Interactive parameter estimation example:**
A simple example of logistic growth (not written in PhysiCell) to showcase the multilevel sweep feature. Demonstrates the implementation of the `MultiLevelSweep` class so that users can understand how it is defined.

- **Data analysis and visualization:**
Examples of data visualization scripts, including interactive examples with Jupyter Widgets.

- üèóÔ∏è **Cell growth (under development):**
Finding the best parameter values for cell cycling rates to model population growth. It also introduces 
gradient-based approaches. Code is available but this example has not been tested and depends on an older version of PhysiCOOL.

More information on each example can be found in the `README.md` files and their corresponding notebooks.

### Online testing

To test PhysiCOOL without installing any of the required libraries or downloading PhysiCell files, visit the [PhysiCOOL Gitpod environment](https://gitpod.io/##https://github.com/IGGoncalves/PhysiCOOL) and navigate to the `examples` folder.

### Local testing

For testing the examples on a local machine, download the `examples` folder from the PhysiCOOL GitHub repository. Subsequently, run the command `jupyter notebook` from that directory to launch Jupyter and you can then run the examples.
